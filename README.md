# 🧾 Producer–Consumer Problem (C / Linux)

## 👩‍💻 1. Program Description (5 points)

This project implements the **Producer–Consumer Problem** using **two separate processes** that communicate through **shared memory** and synchronize using **POSIX semaphores**.

- The **producer** process generates items (`A–J`) and writes them into a shared buffer.
- The **consumer** process reads items from the same buffer and displays them.
- The **shared buffer (table)** can hold **two items** at a time.
- **Semaphores** ensure proper synchronization:
  - Producer waits when buffer is full.
  - Consumer waits when buffer is empty.
  - Both use a **mutex** semaphore for mutual exclusion.

✅ Features implemented:
- Process-level communication (not threads)
- Shared memory for data exchange
- Semaphores for synchronization
- Mutual exclusion to avoid race conditions

## ⚙️ 2. Usage Instructions (5 points)

Follow these exact steps to compile and run the programs on **Linux** (tested on Ubuntu 22.04).

### 🧰 Environment Setup
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
🧱 Step 1 – Compile Both Programs
bash
Copy code
gcc producer.c -o producer -pthread -lrt -Wall
gcc consumer.c -o consumer -pthread -lrt -Wall
▶️ Step 2 – Run the Programs
Open two terminals in your project folder:

Terminal 1 (Producer):

bash
Copy code
./producer
Terminal 2 (Consumer):

bash
Copy code
./consumer
Run the producer first, then the consumer. Both processes communicate via shared memory.

🧼 Step 3 – Clean Up (Optional)
After you’re done, remove shared memory and semaphores to avoid leftovers:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm /dev/shm/sem.sem_*
sudo rm /dev/shm/my_shared_memory
🔍 3. Explanation of Key Components (5 points)
🧩 Shared Memory
Shared memory allows two separate processes to access the same region of memory.

Created with:

c
Copy code
int shm_fd = shm_open("/my_shared_memory", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
ftruncate(shm_fd, sizeof(shared_data));
shared_data *data = mmap(0, sizeof(shared_data), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);
shm_open() creates or opens a shared memory object.

ftruncate() sets its size.

mmap() maps it into both processes’ address space.

🔐 Semaphores
Semaphores control process access to the shared buffer.

Semaphore	Purpose	Initial Value
/sem_empty	Counts empty slots in buffer	2
/sem_full	Counts filled slots	0
/sem_mutex	Controls mutual exclusion	1

Typical usage:

c
Copy code
sem_wait(empty);  // wait for space
sem_wait(mutex);  // enter critical section
// write item to buffer
sem_post(mutex);  // leave critical section
sem_post(full);   // signal item available
⚖️ Mutual Exclusion
sem_wait(mutex) and sem_post(mutex) protect the critical section to prevent both producer and consumer from modifying shared memory simultaneously.
